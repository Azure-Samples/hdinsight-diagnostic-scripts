# Azure HDInsight Diagnostic Scripts

This project contains diagnostic scripts to assist in the creation and management of Azure HDInsight clusters.

[HDInsight Network Validator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-diagnostic-scripts/tree/main/HDInsightNetworkValidator) can be used to ensure there is outbound connectivity from the Virtual Network (VNET) where the HDInsight cluster will be deployed to the required Azure services.

[HDInsight Network Validator v2](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-diagnostic-scripts/tree/main/HDInsightNetworkValidatorV2) can be used to check both outbound and inbound connectivity.
